**비행기 지연/취소로 인해, 레슨 reschedule 요청**

Dear Professor,

I am writing regarding an unexpected inconvenience.

OR I am writing regarding our upcoming lesson. (둘 중 한 문장 선택)

We are supposed to have a lesson at 2pm today. I would like to apologize because I don’t think I can’t meet you on time today due to a flight delay/cancellation. The departure time at Manhattan has been pushed back by two hours. Therefore, the earliest time I can get to your studio would be 5pm.

I was wondering if you could give me another option for our lesson/meeting. I understand that you are busy, so I fully acknowledge the fact that you might be unable to reschedule. However, I would be very delighted if we could meet sometime this week. Please let me know your availability.

I am deeply sorry to have caused any inconvenience, and I appreciate your understanding.

Sincerely,

Name

\*push back = delay
